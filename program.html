    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Open Access in Asia started in the form of subject gateways, informal collections of articles on web pages and
        directories. Subsequently the region witnessed the transition to open access journals and full text repositories
        and digital libraries; however the region has not been able to be very vocal and ongoing about openness due to
        some major challenges. The region as a whole has seen rapid industrial advance with governments investing
        significantly in R&amp;D. Such investment has shown a direct bearing on scientific productivity and reporting
        though not directly or always in Open Access journals.</p>
    <p>The Global Innovation index (GII) report, 2014&nbsp;shows that the Democratic Republic of Korea&nbsp;holds
        world's first rank in terms of Gross Expenditures on Research and Innovation (GERD) in 2011; Singapore, China,
        Malaysia, India and&nbsp;Hong Kong also rank among the top 50.&nbsp;The Directory of Open Access Repositories
        currently registers 586 OA repositories from Asia. In total, this corresponds to 44% of total institutional
        repositories in OpenDOAR. Japan, India, China and Taiwan are major contributors in Asia.&nbsp;However populating
        these repositories has been a major challenge due to the lack of open access awareness and the tendency to get
        published in the conventional model of publishing.</p>
    <p>Now is the prime need for an Asian Regional Meeting in order to assess the lacking this region has been facing in
        terms of open scholarly communication. Now is the time to promote open access in regional basis considering a
        massive amount of research being published annually from Asia which ends up being published in conventional
        models; thus hindering access to the researchers, scientists and students leading to major setbacks in terms of
        advancement of scholarly output.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h2>Why "Open in Action: Reaching The Information Divide" ?</h2>
    <p>The theme exploits openness in terms of education, scholarly publication and data to foster collaborative
        research activities such that there is bridging over the prevalent information divide that transcend the
        boundaries of resources and capacity; and bring researchers and readers into one global open community.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h2>Objectives of the ARM</h2>
